# 2020 Advent of Code
This repo is consisted of my solutions to the challenge [`Advent of Code`](https://adventofcode.com/).

The solutions are written in `Rust`, which is currently one of my preferred programming languages.

## Challenge
I joined the challenge on Dec 1st 2020 because of the invitation from my best colleague [Yu-Shan Lin](https://github.com/SLMT). This challenge lasts 25 days until Christmas. I will try my best to submit the solution every day.

## How to Run?
I'll put my solution in the directory `src/bin`.

Check the name of the binaries for all the puzzles below and the corresponding input txt path:
| Day | Name | To Run | To Test |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Report Repair | `cargo run --bin day01 input_data/day01_input.txt` | `cargo test --bin day01` |
| 2 | Password Philosophy | `cargo run --bin day02 input_data/day02_input.txt` | `cargo test --bin day02` |
| 3 | Toboggan Trajectory | `cargo run --bin day03 input_data/day03_input.txt` | `cargo test --bin day03` |
