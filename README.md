# 2020 Advent of Code
This repo is consisted of my solutions to the challenge [`Advent of Code`](https://adventofcode.com/).

The solutions are written in `Rust`, which is currently one of my preferred programming languages.

## Challenge
I joined the challenge on Dec 1st 2020 because of the invitation from my best colleague [Yu-Shan Lin](https://github.com/SLMT). This challenge lasts 25 days until Christmas. I will try my best to submit the solution every day.

## How to Run?
I'll put my solution in the directory `src/bin`.

Check the name of the binaries for all the puzzles below and the corresponding input txt path:
| Day | Name | Part | To Run | To Test |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Report Repair | 1 | `cargo run --bin day01_part1 input_data/day01_input.txt` | `cargo test --bin day01_part1` |
| 1 | Report Repair | 2 | `cargo run --bin day01_part2 input_data/day01_input.txt` | `cargo test --bin day01_part2` |
